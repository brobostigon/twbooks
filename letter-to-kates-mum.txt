Hello. I am Philip, Kate's fiance of 3 years and 5 months and Avas father.
I understand from Kate, that there is and has been some conflict where mine and kate's relationship is concerned, and where my role in avas life is concerned.
As i understand from kate there are two main important issues, as to if i am suitable for your daughter, and what my role in my daughter avas life is concerned.
To get to the first of those, myself and kate started to get to know eachother roughly 6 years ago now, and we started going out together in july 5 years ago, we knew at that point that we wanted to get to know eachother better and potentially build a life together, which we have been doing, as getting engaged three years ago shows.
I am fully committed to your daughter, i am and always have been there by her side through a lot of good and bad times together, and always will be there by her side, of that there is no doubt.
To get to my second point, if you ask both myself and kate, we were and are both very happy to have ava in our lives, but also as kate will tell you, i am and have been a good father to ava, and do as much as i can considering i dont live with kate nor ava and have my own flat.
Myself and kate have been discussing me moving in with her, because firstly we both feel sometimes that kate needs more help with ava, and being there with kate and ava full time, i am able to do that.
And secondly we believe after over 3 years of being engaged, that planning me and kate getting married as well as moving in together needs to be in the planning now, as it is the right time for us, ava and our relationship.
I hope we all can work together in resolving any conflicts, and after some years of kate expressing these conflicts to me, that they can be worked out and we all can move on from them.
