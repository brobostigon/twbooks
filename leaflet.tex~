  Pathfinder and 'Dungeons and Dragons' are traditional D20 based, medieval setting RPG's. Starfinder is equally a D20 based RPG, however as its based in the future it has significant differences, including a variety of different charecter races, which include the Android, and a veriety of different charecter classes, which include the Technomancer.
