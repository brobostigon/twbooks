TaylorWorld aims to bring table top role playing games to a wider audience, and precipitate that people can learn and get to know them more easily.
We also aim to write and publish adventure paths and other books, for everyone, as well as for specialist audiences like those with autism and other disabilities, as table top role playing games help them with several skills, including social, logic, imagination, interpretation and reading skills.
We also aim to sell all the things required to play those games, including rule books, figures, maps and charecter sheets. As well as personal support with those role playing products.
Our aim is to initially focus on Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder, as those are the most common and most played table top role playing games, and then in the future expand to sell and support others.
Initially it will be Philip and Paul, running and being directors of TaylorWorld, as well as doing the majority of company work.
