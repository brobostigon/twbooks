TaylorWorld aims to bring table top role playing games into a wider audience, and precipitate that people can learn and get to know them more easily.
We also aim to write specialist adventure paths and other books, for specialist audiences, like those with autism and other disabilities. We also aim and will 
focus on people with certain disabilities, as table top role playing games help them with several skills, including social, logic, imagination, interpretation and 
reading skills.
