TaylorWorld aims to bring table top role playing games to a wider audience, and precipitate that people can learn and get to know them more easily.
We also aim to write and publish adventure paths and other books(under open gaming licence and pathfinder and starfinder licence), for everyone as well as for specialist audiences like those with autism and other disabilities, as table top role playing games help them with several skills, including social, logic, imagination, interpretation and reading skills.
We also aim to sell all the things required to play those games, including rule books, dice, figures, maps and charecter sheets. As well as personal support with those role playing products, including us hosting space for people to play their games.
Our aim is to initially focus on Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder and Starfinder, as those are the most common and most played table top role playing games, and then in the future expand to sell and support others.
Initially it will be Philip and Paul, running and being directors of TaylorWorld, as well as doing the majority of company work.
Our main sales channel initally will be our website, and then in time a store, as well as hosting games and doing sessions in other venues as asked for by our customers and others.
