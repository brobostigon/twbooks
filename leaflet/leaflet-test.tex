We are experts in the Table Top \glspl{rpg}, Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder and Starfinder. Our website is https://odoo.taylorworld.one and our contact email is ptaylor@taylorworld.one.
 
If you see this leaflet and your interested in exploring these Table Top Role Playing Games, either email us, show your interest in the Bailiffs Tap in Banbury, Oxfordshire and ask for Dan, or leave a message on our Facebook page https://www.facebook.com/brobostigon/ .
 
We will be hosting games and information sessions at the Bailiffs Tap in Banbury, Oxfordshire, which we will publish on our Facebook Page, where you can get reacquainted with the table-top \glspl{rpg} you love and remember, as well as for people newly interested in table-top \glspl{rpg}, to start their learning experience with us. We will be doing taster sessions as well, of the released versions of Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder and Starfinder. With Dungeons and Dragons, we specifically specialise in the First Edition of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons.
 
Pathfinder and `Dungeons and Dragons' are both D20 based, medieval and fantasy setting \glspl{rpg}. Starfinder is also a D20 based \gls{rpg}, however with a Sci-Fi setting based in the future, it has some differences, including different character races, which include the Android and the Ysoki, different character classes, which include the Technomancer and the Mystic, and other differences. Starfinder also includes things like Laser Pistols and Star-ships.
