  Pathfinder and 'Dungeons and Dragons' are traditional D20 based, medieval setting RPG's. Starfinder is also a D20 based RPG, however its based in the future, and has significant differences, a variety of different charecter races, which include the Android and the Ysoki, a veriety of different charecter classes, which include the Technomancer and the Mystic. Starfinder also includes things like Laser Pistols, StarShips, cybernetic enhancements and different ways of casting magic, like the Spell Cache the Technomancer recieves, which is simlar to the Arcane Bond or the Arcane Focus in Pathfinder, which allows you to store a spell in an object (commonly for the Technomancer this is some sort of Technological Device), and cast another spell per day of a level you know.
