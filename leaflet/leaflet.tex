  Pathfinder and 'Dungeons and Dragons' are both D20 based, medieval and fantasy setting RPG's. Starfinder is also a D20 based RPG, however with a Sci-Fi setting based in the future, it has some differences, including different character races, which include the Android and the Ysoki, different character classes, which include the Technomancer and the Mystic, and other differences. Starfinder also includes things like Laser Pistols and Star-ships.
