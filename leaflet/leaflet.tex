  Pathfinder and 'Dungeons and Dragons' are D20 based, medieval setting RPG's. Starfinder is also a D20 based RPG, however with a Sci-Fi setting based in the future, it has some differences, including different character races, which include the Android and the Ysoki, different character 
classes, which include the Technomancer and the Mystic, and other basic details. Starfinder also includes things like Laser Pistols and 
Star-ships.
