\textbf{`Announcing TaylorWorld's New Dungeons and Dragons Game.'}

---

We are interested in most Table Top Role-Playing Games (RPGs), such as
Dungeons and Dragons, and are looking for players to join us to begin
the first game of an Advanced Dungeons and Dragons D20 based, medieval
and fantasy RPG campaign based in `The World of Greyhawk' world setting.
The game is open to both sexes of all ages, however as the game will
tackle adult themes, provided you can watch an 18 rated film it's all
good with us!

Games will hopefully be played on Saturday afternoons at the `Bailiffs
Tap' next to the `Three Pigeons' so register your interest by emailing
us.
