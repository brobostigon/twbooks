We at TaylorWorld, are a group of enthusiastic gamers who mostly play table top role playing games like Dungeons and Dragons, as well as interest in other games like Chess and Magic: the gathering.
We, depending on the interest, would like to host games at The Apothecary tap, on Church Lane in Banbury.
So if you have interest in joining us for it and you have ideas on when they can be hosted, please email us at ptaylor@taylorworld.one or yossarian76543@yahoo.co.uk, or visit on our Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/brobostigon.
