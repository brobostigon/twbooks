  Position Statement of the applicant Philip Martin Taylor, for the directions hearing on the 14Th of November 2018 at 10am, before District Judge Wakem, concerning my Declaration of Parentage application, so i can be part of my daughter Ava's life and be her father, and Ava having her father in her life.
\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
  My position is as follows:
\end{flushleft}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item I filed this application so it can be conclusively decided that i am Ava's father, and arrangements to be made so i can be part of Ava's life, and Ava to have her father in her life.
  \item The only recent contact i have had with Kate, is when Kate called me on the 6Th of October at roughly 11:30 am regarding receipt of my application. In January 2018 when she sent me the first scans of Ava from the twelve week scan, and when i invited Kate to mediation, which she refused to attend. and have had no contact at all, with my daughter Ava.
  \item I request that the court makes a decision as to if i am Ava's father, as well as arrangements so Ava can have her father in her life, as well as my daughter Ava being in my life.
  \item I also ask the court to make an interim contact arrangement, so my daughter Ava can see me, until a more permanent decision is made at a later hearing in the future.
    \item It is also importent for Ava's welfare, that arrangements be made that when Kate is ill due to her bipolar disorder. That firstly, when Kate does get ill, or is howing signs of getitng ill, steps can be taken to ensure Ava's welfare. Secondly, once Kate's bipolar has improved, that gradual steps are taken so Ava can resume seeing her mother Kate.
