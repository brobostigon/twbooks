Consent application to vacate hearings and withdrawal of declaration of parentage application



OX18P00494



Mr Philip Martin Taylor and Miss Kate Louise Briggs, agree together that we wish for any scheduled hearings to be vacated and Mr Taylor's declaration of parentage application to be withdrawn.



Miss Briggs has acknowledged that I am the father of our daughter Ava, and that we will, within the context of mediation come to agreements where Parental Responsibility and Child Arrangements are concerned, as well as other arrangements where my role in Ava's life are concerned, which we have already been working on since the FHDRA hearing on 14th November. We have already been referred to mediation and started that process, 'National family Mediation, Case Reference:OXF29632'.



Mr Taylor has had contact with Ava several times weekly since Monday 19th November, and we agree that regular contact in a similar way should continue, and that we will make agreements using existing contact as a basis.



SIGN/DATED (Philip and Kate)
