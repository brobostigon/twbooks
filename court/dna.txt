I am writing to you concerning the court order dated on the 14Th of November 2018.

Myself and Miss Briggs, after the FHDRA hearing on the 14Th of November got back in contact with each other where Miss Briggs has confirmed and expressed that i am Ava's father and that paternity testing is unnecessary to establish that fact and doesn't need to be established, as well as that its best for Ava's welfare and well being that we work together, and that is what we have been working on since to achieve, as well as my contact with Ava.
Thus i agree with Kate that paternity tests are now unnecessary, and that what me and Kate need to work on at this current point in time is for myself and Kate to agree on parental responsibility, so i am on an equal legal footing as Ava's parent and father as Kate is her mother and parent, as well as other arrangements within the help of mediation.
So to get to the point, i am writing ultimately to ask for withdrawal of my application, and that me and Kate will make the agreements as needed within mediation and refer ourselves to mediation, to make appropriate agreements with Kate where Ava and me are concerned.
