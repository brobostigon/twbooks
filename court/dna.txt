I am writing to you concerning the court order dated on the 14th of november 2018.

Myself and Miss Briggs, after the FHDRA hearing on the 14th of november got back in contact with eachother where Miss Briggs expressed that i am Ava's father and 
that paternity testing is unneccesery and doesnt need to be established, as well as that its best for ava's welfare and wellbeing that we work together, and 
that is what we have been working on since to achieve, as well as my contact with Ava.
Thus i agree with Kate that paternity tests are now uneccesery, and that the only thing that needs working on at this current point in time is for me and kate to agree on parental responsability, so i am on an equal legal footing as ava's parent and father as Kate is her mother and parent.
So to get to the point, i am writing ultimatly to ask for withdrawal of my application, and that me and Kate will make the agreements as needed within mediation 
and refer ourselves to mediation, to make the appropriate agreements with kate where Ava and me are concerned.
