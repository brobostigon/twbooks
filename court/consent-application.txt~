Consent application to vacate hearings and withdrawal of declaration of parentage application
													OX18P00494
Mr Philip Martin Taylor and Miss Kate Louise Briggs, agree together that we wish for any scheduled hearings to be vacated and Mr Taylor's declaration of parentage application to be withdrawn.
Miss Briggs has acknowledged that i am our daughter Ava's father, and that we both will within the context of mediation come to agreements where Parental Responsibility and Child Arrangements are concerned as well as other arrangements where my role within Ava's life are concerned, that we have already been working on since the FHDRA hearing on the 14Th of November. And will refer ourselves to mediation as soon as possible to get that process underway.
Mr Taylor has had contact with Ava several times weekly since Monday the 19Th of November, and we agree that regular contact in a similar way should continue, and will make agreements using exisitng contact as a basis.
